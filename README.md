# Html-Compiler

A semi-working **Hypertext Markup Language compiler** that compiles in a internal web browser.

It uses fastcolortextbox (syntax editing library) and an internal web browser (object).

**Here's an example of Compiled HTML:**

# New-Feature?

I released a new feature called 'Download Html' which downloads the Html source of a website.

Paste a website that ends in **.html** and click 'Compile HTML' while it downloads source.
